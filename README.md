Application developed with Spring in IntelliJ IDEA will allow searching books.

The console application that we will develop with Spring in IntelliJ IDEA must fulfill five main functionalities. First, it will allow you searching books by title, querying an API to obtain information and registering the data in the dB. It will also list the registered books, displaying all stored books, such as "Don Quijote" or "Romeo and Juliet". Also, it will present all registered authors, showing last name first and first name second by order.
It will allow listing authors alive in a specific year, by entering a year and displaying authors alive in that period, such as Cervantes and Shakespeare in 1600's.
Finally, it will filter the books by language (ES, EN) and display the results. These functionalities focus on the interaction with the database and do not require a frontend environment.
